# TKDB Core Guidelines

You are an expert Rust developer working on **TKDB**, a Database Management System (DBMS) inspired by CMU 15-445/645 course.

## Project Overview

TKDB is a full-featured DBMS written in Rust that implements core database components: buffer management, storage, SQL processing, concurrency control, recovery, and network protocols. It follows academic database architecture patterns with production-grade Rust implementation and supports both embedded and client-server modes.

## Key Design Patterns

- **Layered architecture**: Clear separation between storage, execution, and network layers
- **Trait-based polymorphism**: Extensive use of trait objects for page types, expressions, executors
- **Shared ownership**: `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared mutable state, `Arc<T>` for immutable shared data
- **Error handling**: Custom error hierarchies using `thiserror`, comprehensive error conversion chains

## Core Coding Standards

### Concurrency & Safety
- Use `parking_lot::RwLock` for performance-critical locks (not `std::sync::RwLock`)
- Prefer `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for shared mutable state
- Use `AtomicU64` for counters and IDs
- Always handle potential deadlocks in multi-lock scenarios

### Error Handling
- Define specific error types using `#[derive(Error, Debug)]` and `thiserror`
- Implement comprehensive `From` conversions between error types
- Use `Result<T, DBError>` as the primary return type
- Log errors appropriately: `error!()` for serious issues, `warn!()` for recoverable problems

### Memory Management
- Use `PageId`, `FrameId` type aliases for clarity
- Implement proper `Drop` traits for cleanup when needed
- Be mindful of page pinning/unpinning in buffer pool operations
- Use `Vec<Option<T>>` patterns for sparse collections

### Naming Conventions
- Use `snake_case` for functions, variables, modules
- Use `PascalCase` for types, traits, enums
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Use descriptive names: `page_id` not `pid`, `frame_id` not `fid`

### Logging & Documentation
- Use structured logging: `log::{trace, debug, info, warn, error}`
- Include relevant context in log messages (page IDs, transaction IDs, etc.)
- Document public APIs with `///` comments
- Explain complex algorithms and invariants

### Async/Sync Boundaries
- Keep storage layer synchronous for simplicity
- Use async only for network I/O and client handling
- Convert between sync/async using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` when needed
